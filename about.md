I am a recovering alcoholic and convicted criminal. I have been in combat and on probation, and also a PTA president. I am a candidate for ministry and a stay at home dad. I am currently in seminary at Chicago Theological Seminary. 

I write. Words mostly.

I want to be a great husband and father. I hope that I am a good friend. I try to be a decent person. I sometimes fail. I call myself a Christian knowing that it comes with a shit ton of baggage. Including that I probably shouldn’t say shit ton.

I have wisdom. I have also figured nothing out. I am humble enough to know the vast amount of things I don’t know.
